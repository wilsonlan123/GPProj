o Create a README.MD file in the repo that contains:
▪ Identification of the team members.
▪ A description of your game and introduce the game rules.
▪ A list of features that you have implemented and explain how each coding element
1 to 5 listed under the coding requirements aforementioned support your features.
▪ A list of non-standard C/C++ libraries, if any, that are used in your work and integrated
to your code repo. Please also indicate what features in your game are supported by
these libraries.
▪ Compilation and execution instructions. This serves like a "Quick start" of your game.
The teaching team will follow your instructions to compile and run your game.


Code Requirement. Your implementation should include all the following coding elements:
o Generation of random game sets or events
o Data structures for storing game status (e.g., arrays, STL containers)
o Dynamic memory management (e.g., dynamic arrays, linked lists, STL containers)
o File input/output (e.g., for loading/saving game status)
o Program codes in multiple files (recall separate compilation)
o Proper indentation and naming styles
o In-code documentation
